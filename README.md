# Roll-A-Dice
This is a fun two-player game. If luck favours you it might be your dayðŸ˜‰.

In this game you have to roll the dice and it will get added to your current score only if you decide to hold on to it. If one rolls up, all your score will be gone and it will be the next player to test his/her fate. 

The first one to reach 100 points wins the game.
